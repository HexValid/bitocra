bitocra is a small, clear bitmap font especially for viewing a lot of lines of code or other text at once.  It is somewhat stylized after the old OCR-A font, with many changes due to the format and size. It has all iso-8859-1 characters

bitocrafull is the same basic font, with extensive support for Latin unicode characters.  Many of the characters in Latin Extended-A (primarily characters used in Eastern European languages as well as some others)  are experimental, as I don't use them, and need confirmation from someone more used to them as to their correctness.Any input in this area is welcome.

Licence:
Licence is as yet unsorted. For now, people can use, distribute, modify, and redistribute all of the bitocra files freely, provided only that the modified versions have a licence conforming to the Open Source Definition.  I would appreciate knowing about the distribution of modified versions, but do as you like.  Look for a real licence soon.  I have no idea if this is even legally binding, but I hope it will be respected until the rest is worked out.
