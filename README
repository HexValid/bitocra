bitocra is a small, clear bitmap font especially for viewing a lot of
lines of code or other text at once.  It is somewhat stylized after the
old OCR-A font, with many changes due to the format and size. It has all
iso-8859-1 characters

bitocrafull is the same basic font, with extensive support for Latin
unicode characters.  Many of the characters in Latin Extended-A
(primarily characters used in Eastern European languages as well as some
others)  are experimental, as I don't use them, and need confirmation
from someone more used to them as to their correctness.Any input in this
area is welcome.


Install instructions:

In many distros, you can simply extract the archive to you ~/.fonts
folder, or /usr/share/fonts (or one of it's subdirectories) if you want
it to be available to all users.  After that, update your font cache
with:

fc-cache -fv

And restart your X session.  If you want to add it to your X core fonts,
you will need to move to the directory and run "mkfontdir," add the
directory to your X fontpath (with a command like "xset fp+
/path/to/font"... there are different ways of making this permanent in
different distros), and then run "xset fp rehash".

DEBIAN & UBUNTU:

In Debian and Ubuntu, bitmap fonts are disabled by default. This can be fixed by
running the following command:

sudo rm /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf

After that, the above directions ought to work.
