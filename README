bitocra is a small, clear bitmap font especially for viewing a lot of
lines of code or other text at once.  It is somewhat stylized after the
old OCR-A font, with many changes due to the format and size. It has all
iso-8859-1 characters

bitocrafull is the same basic font, with extensive support for Latin
unicode characters.  Many of the characters in Latin Extended-A
(primarily characters used in Eastern European languages as well as some
others)  are experimental, as I don't use them, and need confirmation
from someone more used to them as to their correctness.Any input in this
area is welcome.
